# Mnist-dataset

### Task
I wrote this notebook for an exercise which the goal was reaching over 97% accuracy on the test set.

### About the dataset
Data was downloaded using fetch_openml().


### General
First I tained the model with the full dataset and got a pretty good results but I tried data augmentation and results got even prettier and error rate dropped quite a bit.
This was a classification task, so I used a confusion matrix like always and computed precision, recall and f1-score to evaluate the model.

For Further explanation check out the notebook.
